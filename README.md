# Sign Detection Project

---

**This project covers the basics of a machine learning model.**

1. Image collection.
2. Label the collected images using `labelImg` module.
3. Split data into different training sets.
4. Used transfer learning through the `TensorFlow Object Detection Api` to train our model.
5. Export our model.
6. Converted trained model into `TensorflowJS` format.
7. Uploaded to ibm cloud.
8. Created a simple GUI with react to consume the model with `TensorFlowJS` and detect in real life with a prettier UI.

<br/>

>*Note: in order to have a better expereince with the model detection, it should be trained at least with 20.000 epochs. However you might have some CPU limitations.*
